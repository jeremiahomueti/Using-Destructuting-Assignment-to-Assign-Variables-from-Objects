//Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects


//The next few lessons will be about destructuring assignments.

var voxel = {x: 3.6, y: 7.4, z: 6.54};


//old way of destructuring each variable and assigning them to
//..their own variables
var x = voxel.x; //x = 3.6
var y = voxel.y; //y = 7.4
var z = voxel.z; //z = 6.54
